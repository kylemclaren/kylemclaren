I keep databases and web applications up and running. I specialize in DevOps, Site Reliabilty Engineering (SRE) and related technologies such as Kubernetes and Terraform.

#### About me

I'm an engineer based in Johannesburg, South Africa with 6+ years of experience working on cloud infrastructure.

Shortly after joining the team at Compose (a Y Combinator-backed Database-as-a-Service startup), we were acquired by IBM and I have stayed on to grow my role to that of a Subject Matter Expert in the Compose domain, which includes deep technical knowledge of the OSS database engines themselves but also of the Compose proprietary platforms, of which there are three.

Among other responsibilities, I help to diagnose database/platform issues, keep databases healthy and running and work with our Premium, Fortune 500 customers on configuration and performance improvements for their business-critical systems.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- Amazon Web Services
- Kubernetes
- Istio
- ArgoCD
- Terraform
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- Prometheus + Grafana
- InfluxDB
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- AWS SQS
- Cloudflare Workers
- Sysdig
